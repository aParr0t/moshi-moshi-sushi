# Moshi Moshi Sushi

This is a website I made for a local sushi shop.

This is the link to the website: [https://moshi-moshi-sushii.vercel.app/](https://moshi-moshi-sushii.vercel.app/)

In this project I challenged myself with 3D graphics, because I wanted the website to pop. 
I designed the website by myself using figma. After the design was done I coded it. The hardest part was getting the 3D model to work and move correctly.

These are the technologies I used to make the website:
- Next.js (React)
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- Headless CMS (Directus)
- GitHub & Git
- Figma
- Three.js
